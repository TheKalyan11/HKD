    text: "It is our first and foremost objective to inspire people to chant the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra. Chanting the holy name is the Yuga-dharma; and Supreme Lord Sri Krishna descended as Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu to inaugurate this dharma and propagate the Sankirtana Movement. He desired that the entire world be inundated with the chanting of the holy name. Srila Prabhupada accepted this as the mission of his life and established the world-wide Hare Krishna Movement to spread the holy names. Following in his footsteps, we, the disciples of Srila Prabhupada, have initiated various programs like Chanters Club, Harinam Festival, Hare Krishna Flash Mobs, etc., to spread the holy names and inspire as many people as possible to chant the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra.",

    title: "2. Gorgeous Deity-Worship and Opulent Festivals",
    text: "The second objective is to maintain opulent and gorgeous Deity worship along with festivals on a grand scale throughout the year. The Supreme Lord Krishna has appeared before us in the form of a Deity to accept our services. Srila Prabhupada established Deity worship as an important part of the Krishna Consciousness movement. He had set-up temples around the world so that his disciples can serve the Deities every day. He also emphasized on decorating the Deities and celebrating festivals in an exuberant manner throughout the year. The Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna is present in the Deity form. By serving Him, we can purify ourselves from material contamination. By engaging all our senses in directly serving Him, we can get rid of our non-devotional tendencies. It also brings steadiness to our materially agitated mind.",

Srila Prabhupada is the spiritual ambassador who visited this mortal world to show us the path back to Godhead. As his disciples, it is our duty to create awareness about him. He is a bona fide spiritual master in the disciplic succession originating from Brahma. A bona fide spiritual master is not an ordinary man. Just as an ambassador is an authorized representative of his country, similarly, a spiritual master, who comes in the disciplic succession, parampara, is an empowered representative of God. Ordered by his spiritual master, he embarked on his life’s mission to spread the message of Krishna to the English-speaking community. He built a house in which the whole world could live.",

He founded the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in 1972. He wrote more than 70 books which have been translated into 57 languages. To understand any philosophy, reading books form an important tool of comprehension for a reader. Srila Prabhupada encouraged his devotees to circulate books among different communities. Reading books form the basis of understanding the Hare Krishna movement. You can access the catalog of his books. Some of these books are also available for download. We also encourage devotees to read and distribute these books. Srila Prabhupada said that this service of book distribution makes him happy.",

We provide various opportunities for our donors and patrons to advance in their spiritual life by educating them on the principles of spiritual life through the books written by Srila Prabhupada. The patrons are also invited on special occasions like their birthday or marriage anniversary, to visit the temple and take the blessings of the Lord.

As you exit the temple hall, there are various counters selling prasadam (food offered to the Lord) and devotional artifacts. There is an exclusive section for handicrafts called Dakshinakriti.

Krishna Lila Theme Park is one such project which is magnificent in scale. This project is likely to be completed in the year 2021-2022. It is an initiative to present the culture and heritage of our country, as described in the Vedic Scriptures, to the contemporary society in a compelling manner using a narrative strategy – technology assisted multi-sensory immersive and experimental story telling. Disney World and Universal Studios use this kind of communication strategy. We want to use this technology to impress the younger generation with the glories of our heroes like Krishna, Rama, Hanuman, etc. The cost estimate of this project is Rs.350 crores. This Theme Park will be a landmark destination in cultural and religious tourism in Bengaluru.",

Srila Prabhupada always instructed his disciples to accept a simple life style. He always stressed on simple living and high thinking. He initiated the farm project at New Vrindavan, United States.

Food offered to Lord Krishna, known as prasādam, is divine and has the power to relieve suffering by freeing one from sinful reactions. Śrīla Prabhupāda strongly emphasized that no one should go hungry in the presence of a temple or a devotee.\n\nIn the spirit of this instruction, Hare Krishna Movement Dehradun regularly distributes prasādam in Haridwar to thousands of pilgrims and sadhus who visit the holy dhāma throughout the year. This sacred food distribution program serves nutritious and sanctified meals with devotion and care, enabling pilgrims to spiritually benefit while undertaking their sacred journey.\n\nAll our food distribution activities are carried out with a commitment to sustainability and socially responsible practices, ensuring purity, dignity, and long-term positive impact.",
